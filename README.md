# Adriann-C-Exercises
This project is a compilation of small programs which are the solutions of the exercises found in Adriann's GitHub (https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html).

This is a way for me to polish my skills in programming so they don't get rusty, since in my University, the professors seem to be teaching anything but programming to Computer Science students, and also, a way for me to believe that I'm actually doing something while 

While I believe that these exercises won't be enough for me to start working in real life, I'm certain that they will serve at least to build upsome experience in the field to solve programming problems by myself, instead of having to rely on Stack Overflow whenever I find a roadblock.
